## Summary
This project supports the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) Osprey Public Safety Initiative by summarizing osprey activity trends from wildlife-activity reporting data. The goal is to help aviation-safety partners understand how often osprey are observed at DTW and how those observations change over time. The resulting summaries provide clear, defensible information to support proactive wildlife-hazard reduction, protect aircraft operations, and reduce risk to the traveling public. Because osprey are large, fish-eating raptors that frequently use developed structures and surrounding habitats, monitoring their occurrence is critical to aviation-safety risk management. This project establishes a consistent and transparent framework for evaluating osprey activity patterns and communicating risk to stakeholders, while also supporting annual wildlife-hazard reporting and documentation efforts at DTW.
